Earth, the planet we live on, has not fully explored yet. There are many mysteries beneath out feet.

The deepest level known of the sea is Mariana trench, which has depth of 10,973 metres (11km). The earth itself has diameter of 12.756 kilometres. So, the center of the earth would be 6.373 km.

There are many layers on earth:

1. Crust (0-100km).

This is the outermost layer of earth. We are living on it. This include seafloor and landmasses.

Here, we can find Kamioka Observatory from Japan that is 10k metres deep. Not only that, there are many research labs or bunker in this layer.

2. Mantle (35 - 2900km)

Mantle is the thickest layer of earth, denser than crust. It's very very hot, around 1000 to 3700 celcius. Even rock melted, but still looks solid because of the pressure.

3. Outer Core

4400 degrees celcius. This part of earth generates enormous amount of electric currents that protects us from cosmic radiation in the space.

4. Inner Core

This is the hottest part of earth. There are many mysteries to uncover about this. There may be a core inside a core.


### Deepest point

The deepest hole humans have dug is Kola Superdeep Borehole in Northwestern Russia, near Norwegian border, reached 12,262 metres, deeper than mariana trench. It was dug to study continental crust's structure and geology. The temperature down there is 180 degree celcius.

The drill melted, so it was stopped in 1992.
