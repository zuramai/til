1. Blind luck, where a lucky event happens out of your control, without any intervention. This is pure luck and people consider it as fate.
2. Hustle luck, a luck that happens because of your effort that eventually the luck will find you. You work very hard
3. Skill luck, you are really good at your field that will make you really good at spotting luck, when the luck will show up, based on your knowledge and experience.
